# Project Title
### DeepSkinCancer: Detection and Classification Using Advanced Deep Learning Algorithms
# Description
DeepSkinCancer: Detection and Classification Using Advanced Deep Learning Algorithms is a deep learning-based project aimed at early detection and classification of skin cancer using advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, and Xception, this project improves diagnostic accuracy in identifying nine different types of skin cancer from medical images.

The project utilizes data augmentation, preprocessing techniques, and fine-tuning of CNN architectures to achieve high classification accuracy. With a dataset of 2080 images from ISIC, the model is trained using SGD optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function, evaluating performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The final trained model, which achieved the best results with Xception, is intended for deployment on AWS Cloud using Flask or FastAPI, making it accessible for real-world applications in dermatology.

## Data Preprocessing
### Training Data Augmentation:
```sh
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255, 
    shear_range=0.2, 
    zoom_range=0.2, 
    horizontal_flip=False
)
```
### Test Data Preprocessing:
```sh
test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
```
## Model Architectures Used
We experimented with multiple deep learning models:

- `VGG16`: A widely used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with 16 layers. It follows a simple and uniform design with small 3×3 convolution filters and is known for its high accuracy in image classification tasks.

- `ResNet50`: A 50-layer deep residual network that introduces skip connections (residual learning) to avoid the vanishing gradient problem. It allows training of very deep networks with improved performance.

- `DenseNet169`: A densely connected CNN with 169 layers, where each layer receives input from all previous layers. This promotes feature reuse and reduces the number of parameters compared to traditional deep networks.

- `DenseNet201`: A deeper variant of DenseNet with 201 layers, further improving accuracy and efficiency through better feature propagation and gradient flow.

- `Xception`: An extension of the Inception architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining high performance. It achieved the best accuracy in our experiments.
